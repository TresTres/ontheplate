**Describe the issue or provide a code snippet**
Make sure it's clear what we should be looking at

**Pitfalls to this approach**
What grievance is being committed here? 
Did this violate KISS/SLAP/DRY?
Is this a performance bottleneck?
Is this going to cause problems with extensibility?

**Suggested Fix**
There's probably a better way you're thinking of.

**Estimation of effort**
Is this a tedious replacement across 6 files, or an entire refactor?
