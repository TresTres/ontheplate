## What This Is
An attempt to keep myself sane.  Using GraphQL, React(?), Express, Nodejs, and MongoDB.  The MERNG stack...or GERMN...MERINGUE?

One way I've attempted to manage my mess of a life is by maintaining a lot of lists using the Notes app on my phone or on pen and paper.
This isn't the best for keeping track of discrete lists because the info isn't very rich - I end up with a scrawled list on my work desk for professional stuff, another list at home for chores, a list on my phone for grocery shopping, a different list on my phone for department store shopping, et cetera.  And God knows what happens if I attempt to throw deadlines on anything.

Many things often fall through the cracks one way or another - either I don't have a unified system in place to keep track of what's going on, or I'm forced to commit significantly towards keeping it all in order - while the information is very valuable, the actual practice of sitting in front of google calendar and creating weekly schedules for two hours is pretty unproductive, and I'm not likely to maintain that practice  

The specific thing here is I should be able to process my info in one place, and in whichever mode I choose.  I should be able to shift between a ***spotlight*** (here are all my upcoming appointments this month for my vet, my doctor, my money launderer, etc) and a ***laser-focus*** (here's what I set up to do today across all my lists - appointments, work deadlines, whoever's birthday I probably forgot anyway, etc).  As this is pretty similar to how the human attention span works, this also serves as an attention hack.  I'm very much okay with automating this part of my cognitive load away.

## To Do
1.  Likely want to get metrics about a list without having to access the list itself, so change the percentDone into some sort of list-metadata to get a number breakdown that's easily usable on the front-end
